        <p>I used the PokÃ©API as the main tool to bring this experience to life, applying API consumption concepts and putting both use client and use server from Next.js into practice â€” using use client only when it was truly necessary. This is actually a pretty old project, from back when Next.js still used the pages router. I decided to update it because it didnâ€™t follow best practices at the time, and I wanted to improve it overall. So yeah â€” itâ€™s not exactly a serious portfolio project, but it was a lot of fun to build and experiment with all these concepts. Hope you enjoyed it too! ðŸ˜Š</p>
