      <p>This is a project that I made for those who love pokemon and want to search your favorite Pokemon. </p> 
      <p>One of the challenges of this project is designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the extensive amount of information in the Pokedex. </p>
      <p> I'm working on creating a search functionality that allows users to quickly find the Pokemon they're looking for, as well as a detailed view for each Pokemon that includes images and descriptions.</p>
      <p> Overall, I'm really excited about this project and can't wait to see the final product. It's been a great opportunity to combine my passion for programming with my love for the Pokemon franchise, and I hope that other fans will find it useful and enjoyable to use.</p>
