# 🧠 Pokédex with Next.js + PokéAPI
Welcome to my Pokédex project, built with lots of love for Pokémon fans!
This project was developed using Next.js, fetching data directly from the PokéAPI to create a fun and interactive way to search and view Pokémon.

## 🚀 Features

📋 Listing of the first 100 Pokémon with images and names

📄 Individual Pokémon detail pages (work in progress)

⚡ Fast interface with server-side rendering (SSR)

🌐 Smart use of use client only where necessary

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS
- PokéAPI

## 💡 What I Learned
Consuming REST APIs with Axios and TypeScript

Asynchronous rendering with Next.js

Using Suspense for loading states in Server Components

Best practices separating client and server code

⚠️ Notes
This project started back when Next.js used the pages/ routing system.
I recently updated it to the new App Router (app/) and modern best practices.

## 💬 Final Thoughts
This isn't a professional portfolio project, but I had a lot of fun building it — and I hope you enjoy exploring it too!
